# The rigth algorithm make a great difference 
I wrote just a small example script to show you how huge the difference in running time can be when you 
choose the wrong algorithm for your project.

### What to do:
1. Compile the following code and run it on an input "40" to see how long it for this  algorithm "slow_fibonacci(number)"  to show the output 
2. Comment the lines "slow_fibonacci(number)" and uncomment the line "fast_fibonacci(number)" compile, run it again on a input of "40" and =>  see the magic happen!!
